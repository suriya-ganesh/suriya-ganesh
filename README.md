👋 Hello, World! I'm Suriya Ganesh
🚀 Software Engineer | 🔐 Privacy Enthusiast | 🧠 ML Tinkerer | ☕ Coffee Connoisseur
💻 Tech Stack & Expertise

My code is like my coffee: strong, refined, and occasionally keeps me up at night. 🌙

__Languages__: Rust 🦀, Go, C++ , Python 🐍, Java, JavaScript 

__Domains__: Data Privacy, Federated Learning, Privacy-Preserving Technologies, Distributed Systems

__Tools__: Kafka, k8s, Docker, AWS-GCP-Azure et al., Ray, PyTorch, ONNX.

## 🔍 Current Focus

Exploring the intersection of Privacy and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. Because who says you can't have your cake and eat it privately too? 🍰🕵️


## 🛠️ Past Lives

Designed and built a Federated Learning platform that scaled to 100M users
Optimized a governance engine, slashing p99 response time from 150ms to 5ms at 15K rps
Migrated a privacy-vault from single-tenant to multi-tenant architecture with multi-region data residency

## 🌱 Always Growing

When I'm not pushing commits, you'll find me:

Devouring books on everything from Plato to Machine Learning (Ask me about the current book that I'm reading.)

Tending to coffee plants (yes, I'm a Java expert in more ways than one ☕).

Staring at my ceiling. (because who needs sleep when you have recursive thoughts?)

## 🎯 Philosophy

I believe in velocity over slowness, output over input, and occasionally, coffee over sleep. My code is like a well-pruned coffee plant: trimmed for efficiency, robust in structure, and produces a rich output.


## 🤝 Let's Connect
Whether you want to discuss the intricacies of PolyMorphic Encryption, debate the best way to optimize a Rust codebase, or just chat about the perfect brew, I'm always open to new connections!
Remember: In the world of software, as in coffee, it's all about finding the right blend of strength, flavor, and a bit of caffeine-induced madness. Let's code something amazing! ☕💻
